# Banc del Temps (bank of time)

This is a sigle-sprint project done during *Factoria F5* Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp.

### What's a Bank of Time?
as stated in their own website:
> A Bank of Time is an economic and social alternative
> to traditional currencies.
> In a Bank of Time abilities are exchanged among members without using money;
> the hours of service (offered and consumed) are counted. You pay with time.

Disclaimer: the original text was in Catalan, so the translation may not be accurate enough, but you get the point.


### What's my approach?
Banks of Time run physically and so it does 'time exchange'. You must go to a specific place to 'register' and get your 1h tickets to use in services.
I love the idea, but the System looks prehistoric to me.

That's why I wanted to modernize their system by:
1. Making a web app in which you can register/login, be aware of services you can 'purchase' with hours around you, upload your services, keep your profile updates (since I believe in this project huaman factor is capital in this project), a rate the services you consumed and so on.
2. Improve their current website UX and UI.
3. Make a simple mobile app to make 'hour exchange' way easier than is now. Like verse or any other fintech app out there: you just send 1 hour of your time when you 'buy' a service, or recieve it in your account when you offer the service. As simple as that.
